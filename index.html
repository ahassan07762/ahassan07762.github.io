								<h2>Off The Beaten Path</h2>
								<p>You've already tried car and RV camping. You've camped at commercial campsites that had a convenient restroom and water supply. Now, you want to explore the road less traveled. Backcountry camping, also known as primitive camping, is a wonderful way to explore the remote and secluded areas of our national forests. However it requires some advanced camping skills.</p>

      								<a href="roadtrip.html">Top Ten U.S. Road Trips for exploring the unknown.</a></h3>
									<p>The lovely country of the United States has so much to offer and is the roadtrip fanatic’s paradise. It is made up of wonderful cities, charming landscapes, majestic mountains, refreshing rivers and lakes, fabulous beaches and great people. It’s no wonder why the US is called “America the Beautiful!” In our opinion, these are America’s 10 most scenic roadtrips listed in alphabetic order by state.</p>

									<h3><a href="international.html">International Travel: Where to go and how to get there.</a></h3>
									<p>Whether you're a lover of history, architecture or nature, only travel will satisfy your passion. No words can describe the rush you feel when gazing upon the Mona Lisa or admiring the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. It is this reason, as well as the shivers one gets when witnessing an ocean sunset, that leads many to hop onto a plane.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-ship">
									<h3>Luxury Cruises</h3>
									<p>Our small ships are able to reach off-the-beaten-path destinations, where passengers can participate in unique shore excursions, from food tastings to walking tours. And thanks to our line's complimentary Amazing Evenings program, guests can immerse themselves in the local culture with an evening ashore spent enjoying a memorable meal on the rolling hills of Tuscany or a spectacular ballet performance in St. Petersburg, Russia.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-binoculars">
									<h3>Hiking and Biking Trails, climbing routes, and trail maps</h3>
									<p>Hiking and biking trails in state parks lead to beautiful vistas and waterfalls, or by wetlands bubbling with life, or through dark, old growth forests, and to uncountable adventures and chances to see wildlife. Some trails are scenic or leisurely, while others are self guiding educational, or rigorous exercise.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-wheelchair">
									<h3>Accessibility and Travel</h3>
									<p>Our core belief is that travel is a force for good. Travel enriches those who are touched by it either directly or indirectly. Travelling with a disability requires a lot of organisation, but information on accessibility is often hard to find. Around 50% of people with a disability would travel more if they could be sure more accessible facilities were available. We believe it’s important to ensure that individuals with a disability have more access to travel opportunities.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-comments-o">
									<h3>Community</h3>
									<p>Our community network connects travelers with locals in over 230 countries and territories around the world. Everyone knows the "tourist attractions" are never the most interesting or exciting things to experience in a new place. Within our community section, members can share their personal travel experiences with one another. These exchanges are a uniquely rich form of cultural interaction. Members have the opportunity to meet people from all over the world without leaving home. This gives individuals the rare ability to participate in the local life of the places they visit.</p>
